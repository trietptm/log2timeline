Log2timeline has the capability to output its results in the bodyfile format which is also used by TSK (The Sleuthkit).  More and more computer forensic tools are able to output their results in the bodyfile format, making it easy to mix output from log2timeline with the output of these tools.

To let the tool output in the mactime bodyfile format use "_logt2imeline_ _-o_ _mactime_"

For further definition of the file format, please refer to the TSK site: http://wiki.sleuthkit.org/index.php?title=Body_file.
